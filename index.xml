Sharon (32), Entrepeneur From San Diego, CA I&amp;rsquo;m a serial entrepeneur, and I rely heavily on Qubit Shield to future-proof my whole tech stack and data pipeline with its encryption technologies based on Quantum Key Distribution. I understand the threat of quantum cyber hacking in the near future, and I want my start-ups to be immune to this upcoming epidemic.</description></item></channel></rss>
