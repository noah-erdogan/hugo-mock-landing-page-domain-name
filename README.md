Github Actions Workflow Docs Feedback:

Thumbs Up.

"This doc was informative and the screenshots helped guide me through each step. The instructions were clear and helpful."

**Workflow**

This project includes a GitHub Actions workflow configuration for building and deploying a Hugo website to GitHub Pages in a YAML file. Any time new changes are pushed, a job is queued and then executed, and the changes are automatically updated at the specified url if the job is successful.

- **Qubit Shield Landing Page**
This repository is a landing page for a mock product called Qubit Shield that was created using Hugo and was originally adapted from a Boostrap Theme landing site. 

**Navigating the Landing Page**
In the top left conrner of the page, the Qubit Shield button routes the site user back to the main page. The contacts button next to it brings the user to a new page that links to the Github repository as well as my email address. The Front and center of the main page is the Qubit Shield logo. The Get Protected button brings the user to the link for this site's Github repository. Below that we have descriptions for our 6 major features with images corresponding to three of them. The recent posts section links to a page on the site for recent updates added to the site. In this case, it features a section on 'The Case for Quantum Encryption". Finally, there are featured posts at the bottom of the site which link to and describe the impact of related publications in the field of quantum encryption, as well as user testimonials. The privacy policies linked at the bottom are identical to that from the original bootstap site and were not changed. 

**About Qubit Shield**

Qubit Shield represents the forefront of quantum encryption technology, designed to offer unprecedented security in the digital age. As quantum computing looms on the horizon, threatening the very fabric of current cryptographic standards, Qubit Shield emerges as a beacon of protection, leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics to secure data against even the most advanced cyber threats.

Our suite of products, including Quantum VPN, Quantum Key Distribution, Quantum Data Vault, and Quantum Random Number Generators, is built on the foundation of quantum encryption. This technology ensures that data, whether in transit or at rest, is encrypted in such a way that it is immune to the decryption capabilities of both today's classical computers and tomorrow's quantum computers.
